# This file is used for declaring various data types for
#  .root file output from NEXTSim. This file is intended
#  to be read by the executable rcbuild. That program
#  will automatically generate the following structure files...
#
#   Structures.cpp
#   Structures.h
#   LinkDef.h
#
# These files will be used in the generation of a root dictionary.
